 ### Work
 
 - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on React projects. Thriving to provide the right answer to the different scenarios y come up with.
 
 - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you need code-related. Will try my best to lend some help or provide further data.
 
 - I am part of a very dedicated group of Developers, we call it @TreeDev. We are starting step by step, team-work, resilience and friendship will ciment our path to a greater programming experience along with bonding and growing.

  - âš¡ Fun fact: I used to play Rugby, team-work and leadership is a very well known feature to myself.
 - âš¡ Another Fun fact: Now I surf, and has become a great passion along with coding. Surf is a very good metaphore for life. A lot of hardwork ultimately pays off in mere seconds of blizz. And repeat. Never giving up will end up in comitting fully to your goals. 

 
 ### Ideas
 - ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open-source social-driven project to enhance the digital experience worldwide.
 
 
 ### Upcoming..
 
  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TDD and BDD in order to provide a better codebase along my pathss.

  Very happy to lend a hand! Always positive.

  I am grateful and always keen to help.
