 - âš¡ Fun fact: I used to play Rugby, being in a cohesive team always played a big role in being succesful,  thats how I earned my experience throughout competitive and humane environments.
 
 - âš¡ Another Fun fact: Now I surf, and has become a great passion along with coding. Surf has proven useful in the way that a lot of hardwork ultimately pays off in mere seconds of blizz. And repeat. That provided me the right space to be able to attach and de attach quickly in evergoing processes of change and development.
 
 
 ### Ideas
 - ðŸ‘¯ Providing the right answers to the perpetual shift of needs society has, is an art itself. We as humans have to find a proper way to address our interaction with technology throught the right debates. Front end has quite a responsability in being constantly adapting to the users eyes in a well designed way. Provided the right tools, the process should enhance the user experience.
 
 
 ### Upcoming..
 
 - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TDD and BDD in order to provide a better codebase along my pathss.


- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I am currently swiping @francdetank in twitter, and in @TreeDev as a team member.
   

 - ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you need code-related. Will try my best to lend some help or provide further data.

  Thanks for reading.

  Frank
